The Sparks Foundation Tasks
This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern for The Sparks Foundation.

Internship Category - Data Science and Business Analytics
Internship Type - Work from Home
In this internship, we were provided some Tasks and I was able to successfully the tasks within the given time-frame.

# Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML

Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables
What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

# Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML 

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually

# Task-3 : Exploratory Data Analysis Retail

# Task-4 : Exploratory Data Analysis on Global terrorism

## Worked on -

->Prediction using Supervised ML

-Prediction of the percentage of marks of a student based on the number of study hours

-Simple Linear regression 

->Prediction using Unsupervised ML

-Performed EDA on the provided dataset and applied K means cluster to find out the number of clusters.

->Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on superstore dataset- Retail

-Performed some analysis operations to find out the reasons for less profit, weak areas where one can work to make more profit.

->Performed EDA on Global Terrorism

## Worked with - 

NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, Scikit Learn, seaborn libraries
